Imogen Heap’s *Mi.Mu Gloves* let her control the music she’s playing in concerts without touching anything. She can make sounds louder, softer, or change their pitch just by moving her hands and fingers in certain ways.

The gloves are filled with sensors that can feel how her hands move, and they talk to a computer that changes the music based on her gestures.
