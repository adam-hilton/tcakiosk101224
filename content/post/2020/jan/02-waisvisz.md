### Instrument: ***The Hands***

##### (1970s)

## &nbsp;

Michel Waisvisz (*said like vice-viss*), a Dutch inventor and musician, developed a groundbreaking instrument called *The Hands*. 

It was big and clunky by today's standards, but it was one of the first computer-based gestural controllers. It was equipped with sensors that sent signals to a computer, which could then change the sound of the music playing depending on how he moved. 

This early invention paved the way for many future developments in movement-based music technology.
