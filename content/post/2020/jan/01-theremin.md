### Instrument: **Theremin**

##### (1920s)

## &nbsp;

Leon Theremin created an instrument in the 1920s named after him: the Theremin. 

The Theremin is an electronic instrument where you donâ€™t touch it at all! By waving your hands near two antennas, one for pitch (how high or low the sound is) and one for volume (how loud or soft), you control the sound. It was one of the first instruments ever to be played with just gestures.

The Theremin uses electric signals to sense how close your hands are, turning those signals into musical notes.

Clara Rockmore, a virtuoso of the Theremin, demonstrated its musical capabilities in the 1930s and beyond.
