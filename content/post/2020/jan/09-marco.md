### Instrument: ***XTH Sense***

##### (2010s)

## &nbsp;

A very recent musician is Marco Donnarumma who created an instrument called *XTH Sense*.

His instrument not only tracks how the muscles in his arms *move*, but also how they ***sound***.

By attaching the sensors to his body, he can control sounds by how his muscles move, while the sounds *in* his body are being amplified at the same time. This makes him both the performer and the instrument.
