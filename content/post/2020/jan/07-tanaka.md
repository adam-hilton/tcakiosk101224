### Instrument: **Muscle Sensors**

##### (2000s)

## &nbsp;

One musician makes sounds with something even simpler than fingers--the muscles in the arms themselves.

Atau Tanaka uses special sensors that track not just how he moves his arms but also how he tightens or relaxes his muscles.

The sensors on his arms use a technology called EMG (electromyography), which reads very small measurements in how his muscles move. These signals are all sent to a computer which creates sounds or controls music based on these muscle signals.
