### Instrument: ***Lady's Glove***

##### (1990s)

Laetitia Sonami was among the first musicians to start using really small sensors that tracked tiny movements.

She developed the *Lady's Glove*, which has sensors that let her make music by moving her hands and fingers. She could control different sounds or even lights by bending her fingers or waving her arms.

Like the examples before her, the *Lady's Glove* is also connected to a computer, and each movement she makes sends signals that control the sound, making it like a musical instrument right around her fingertips.
