### Instrument: ***Theremin***

##### (1920s)

Some movement musicians don't use computers at all, just electricity and manetism.

Leon Theremin created an instrument this way that's named after him: the *Theremin*. 

The *Theremin* uses electric signals to sense how close your hands are, turning those signals into musical notes.

By waving your hands near two antennas, one for pitch (how high or low the sound is) and one for volume (how loud or soft), you control the sound. It was one of the first instruments ever to be played without touching it.
