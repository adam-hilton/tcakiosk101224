Pamela Z uses sensors placed on her body like jewelry to create music. When she moves her hands or body, the sensors send signals to a computer, which changes the sounds she is making in real time during her performances.

The sensors detect movements, like the angle of her arms, and the computer translates these into changes in pitch, rhythm, or effects for her voice or other sounds.
