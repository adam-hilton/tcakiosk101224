### Instrument: **Theremin**

##### (1920s)

###### --

Leon Theremin created an instrument in the 1920s named after him: the theremin. 

It's one of the earliest electronic instruments, and it's controlled without physical contact. Musicians move their hands near two antennas to control pitch and volume.

Clara Rockmore, a virtuoso of the Theremin, demonstrated its musical capabilities in the 1930s.
