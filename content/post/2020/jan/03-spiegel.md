### Instrument: ***Music Mouse***

##### (1980s)

Some early movement-based musicians didn't create new pieces of gear at all, but instead used things that computers already had.

Laurie Spiegel created a special computer program called *Music Mouse* that let people make music by moving their computer mouse--which were brand new at the time. With this program, she could control melodies and harmonies by just moving the mouse around the screen, letting her compose music in a new way.

*Music Mouse* turned mouse movements into musical patterns by using computer algorithms. It allowed anyone to write detailed, complicated music without needing to play an instrument by hand, making music more accessible.
