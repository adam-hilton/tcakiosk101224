### Instrument: **Muscle Sensors**

Atau Tanaka uses special sensors that track the movements of his muscles. As he moves his arms or tightens his muscles, the sensors send information to a computer that turns those movements into sound.

The sensors on his arms use a technology called EMG (electromyography), which reads how his muscles move. The computer then creates sounds or controls music based on these muscle signals.
