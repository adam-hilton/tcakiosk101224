### Instrument: **XTH Sense**

##### (2000s)

## &nbsp;

Marco Donnarumma is known for using XTH Sense, a biosensor technology he developed that captures the sound of muscle movements in real time. By attaching the sensors to his body, Donnarumma can control electronic sounds through his muscle contractions and body movements, making his body both the performer and the instrument.

XTH Sense is a wearable biosensor that detects the low-frequency sounds generated by muscle movements and turns them into sound and control signals. This allows him to create immersive performances where every motion affects the music.
