### Instrument: **The Hands**

##### (1970s)

## &nbsp;

Michel Waisvisz, a Dutch composer and inventor, developed a groundbreaking instrument called The Hands. This instrument allowed him to control electronic sounds by simply moving his hands in the air. By bending his fingers, lifting his arms, or making gestures, he could manipulate the music in real time.

The Hands was one of the first wireless, gestural controllers. It was equipped with sensors that sent signals to a computer, which then changed the sound depending on how he moved. This early invention paved the way for many future developments in gestural music technology.
