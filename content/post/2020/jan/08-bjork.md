### Instrument: **Reactable, Biophilia app**

Bjork (*said like bee-york*) used a device called the Reactable, where she placed blocks on a table to control different sounds by moving them around. She also helped create an app for phones and tablets where people could make their own music by moving things on the screen.

The Reactable uses a camera to track where the blocks are on the table, and it changes the sound as they move. The Biophilia app lets people interact with music by touching and moving things on a digital screen, similar to a game.
