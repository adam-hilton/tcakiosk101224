Lots of movement-based musicians create their instruments at universities, but Onyx Ashanti makes his at home.

Onyx Ashanti has been building and refining what he calls the *Exomesh DataSkin* out of 3D-printed recycled plastics for many years.

He places sensors on nearly every part of his body so that everything he does can have an impact on the sounds of the music he makes--and also his daily life!
