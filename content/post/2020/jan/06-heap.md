Imogen Heap is a musician who took the idea of movement-tracking gloves even further. 

With her *Mi.Mu Gloves*, she can her control many different parts of the music sheâ€™s playing all at once, and all while playing and singing in front of big audiences. 

She can make sounds louder, softer, or change their pitch, how many notes, how far away or close they sound, how crunchy or smooth they are, and on and on. She can do lots of these things at the same time by moving her hands and fingers in very specific ways.
