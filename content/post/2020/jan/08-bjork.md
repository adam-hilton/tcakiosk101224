Bjork (*said like bee-york*) used a device called the *Reactable*, where she placed blocks on a table to control different sounds by moving them around. 

The *Reactable* uses a camera to track where the blocks are on the table, and it changes the sound as they move--like how they're facing, how they're turned, and how close they are to each other. The table also has animations on it that help you understand what's going on.

She also helped create an app for phones and tablets where people could make their own music by moving things on their screens, which was a very new idea at the time.
